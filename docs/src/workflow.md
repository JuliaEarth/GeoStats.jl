# Basic workflow

A basic geostatistical workflow often consists of three steps:

1. Manipulation of geospatial data
2. Definition of geostatistical problem
3. Visualization of problem solution

In this section, we walk through these steps to illustrate some of the
features of the project.

## Manipulating data

The workflow starts with the creation of geospatial data, which can
be loaded from disk or derived from other Julia variables. For example,
given a Julia array (or image), which is not attached to any particular
coordinate system:

```@example workflow
using Plots
gr(format=:svg) # hide

Z = [10sin(i/10) + j for i in 1:100, j in 1:200]

heatmap(Z)
```

We can georeference the array using the [`georef`](@ref) function:

```@example workflow
using GeoStats

Œ© = georef((Z=Z,))
```

The origin and spacing of samples can be specified with:

```@example workflow
georef((Z=Z,), origin=(1.,1.), spacing=(10.,10.))
```

and different geospatial configurations can be obtained with different
methods (see [Data](data.md)).

We plot the geospatial data and note a few differences compared to the
plot shown above:

```@example workflow
plot(Œ©)
```

First, we note that the image was rotated to match the first index `i`
of the array with the horizontal "x" axis, and the second index `j` of
the array with the vertical "y" axis. Second, we note that the image
was stretched to reflect the real `100x200` size of the Cartesian grid.

### Tabular access

Our geospatial data implements the
[Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface, which
means that they can be accessed as if they were tables with samples
in the rows and variables in the columns. In this case, a special
column named `geometry` is created on the fly, row by row, containing
[Meshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl) geometries:

```@example workflow
using Tables

first(Tables.rows(Œ©), 3)
```

We can design advanced **geospatial** queries
using the [Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl) language:

```@example workflow
using Query

t = Œ© |> @mutate(geometry = centroid(_.geometry))
```

and convert the resulting table to geospatial data if a `geometry`
column is present:

```@example workflow
t |> GeoData
```

For convenience, we can retrieve individual columns as vectors:

```@example workflow
Œ©[:Z]
```

or as an array with the correct shape using the `asarray` function:

```@example workflow
asarray(Œ©, :Z)
```

### Geospatial views

Geospatial data can be viewed at a subset of locations without
unnecessary memory allocations:

```@example workflow
Œ©·µ• = view(Œ©, 1:10*100)

plot(Œ©·µ•)
```

We plot a random view of the grid to emphasize that views do not
preserve geospatial regularity:

```@example workflow
inds = rand(1:nelements(Œ©), 100)

plot(view(Œ©, inds))
```

### Geospatial partitions

Geospatial data can be partitioned with various efficient methods.
To demonstrate the operation, we partition our spatial data view into
balls of given radius:

```@example workflow
Œ† = partition(Œ©·µ•, BallPartition(5.))

plot(Œ†)
```

or, alternatively, into two halfspaces:

```@example workflow
Œ† = partition(Œ©·µ•, BisectFractionPartition((1.,1.), 0.5))

plot(Œ†)
```

Geospatial partitions are (lazy) iterators of geospatial views, which
are useful in many contexts as it will be shown in the next section.
To access a subset of a partition, we use index notation:

```@example workflow
plot(Œ†[1])
```

```@example workflow
plot(Œ†[2])
```

Various other geospatial operations are defined in the framework besides
partitioning. For a complete list, please check the [Operations](operations/partitioning.md) section of the reference guide.

## Defining problems

Having defined the geospatial data objects, we proceed and define the
geostatistical problem to be solved. In this guide, we illustrate
*geostatistical learning*. For other types of geostatistical problems,
please check the [Problems](problems.md) section of the documentation.

Let's assume that we have geopatial data with some variable that we want
to predict in a supervised learning setting. We load the data from a CSV
file, and inspect the available columns:

```@example workflow
using CSV
using DataFrames
gr(size=(800,400)) # hide

df = DataFrame(CSV.File("data/agriculture.csv"))

first(df, 5)
```

Columns `band1`, ..., `band4` represent four satellite bands for different
locations `(x,y)` in this region. The column `crop` has the crop type
for each location that was labeled manually with the purpose of training
a learning model.

Because the labels are categorical variables, we need to inform the
framework the correct type:

```@example workflow
using MLJ

df = coerce(df, :crop => Multiclass)

first(df, 5)
```

We can now georeference the table and plot some of the variables:

```@example workflow
Œ© = georef(df, (:x,:y))

gr(format=:png) # hide
plot(Œ©, (:band4,:crop), ms=0.2, mc=:viridis)
```

Similar to a generic statistical learning workflow, we split the data
into "train" and "test" sets. The main difference here is that our
geospatial `split` function accepts a separating plane specified by
its normal direction `(1,-1)`:

```@example workflow
Œ©s, Œ©t = split(Œ©, 0.2, (1.,-1.))

gr(format=:png,aspect_ratio=:equal) # hide
plot(domain(Œ©s), ms=0.2)
plot!(domain(Œ©t), ms=0.2, mc=:green)
```

We can visualize the domain of the "train" (or source) set Œ©s in black,
and the domain of the "test" (or target) set Œ©t in green. We reserved
20% of the samples to Œ©s and 80% to Œ©t. Internally, this geospatial
`split` function is implemented in terms of efficient geospatial
partitions, which were illustrated in the previous section.

Let's define the learning task and the geostatistical learning problem.
We want to predict the crop type based on the four satellite bands.
We will train the model in Œ©s where labels are available, and apply it
to Œ©t, which is our target:

```@example workflow
feats = [:band1,:band2,:band3,:band4]
label = :crop

ùíØ = ClassificationTask(feats, label)

ùí´ = LearningProblem(Œ©s, Œ©t, ùíØ)
```

GeoStats.jl is integrated with the
[MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl)
project, which means that we can solve geostatistical learning problems
with more than 150 classical learning models:

```@example workflow
using MLJ

‚Ñ≥ = @load DecisionTreeClassifier pkg=DecisionTree

‚Ñí = PointwiseLearn(‚Ñ≥())
```

In this example, we selected a `PointwiseLearn` strategy to solve the
geostatistical learning problem. This strategy consists of applying the
learning model pointwise for every point in the spatial data:

```@example workflow
Œ©ÃÇt = solve(ùí´, ‚Ñí)
```

## Plotting solutions

We note that the solution to a geostatistical learning problem is a
geospatial data object, and we can inspect it with the same methods
already described above. This also means that we can plot the solution
directly, side by side with the true label in this synthetic example:

```@example workflow
pÃÇ = plot(Œ©ÃÇt, ms=0.2, mc=:viridis, title="crop (prediction)")
p = plot(Œ©t, (:crop,), ms=0.2, mc=:viridis)

plot(pÃÇ, p)
```

Visually, the learning model has succeeded predicting the crop. We can
also estimate the generalization error of the geostatistical solver with
[geospatial validation methods](validation.md) such as block
cross-validation and leave-ball-out, but these methods deserve
a separate tutorial.

With this example we conclude the basic workflow. To get familiar with
other features of the project, please check the tutorials and the
reference guide.
