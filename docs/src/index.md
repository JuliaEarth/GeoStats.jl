## Overview

In many fields of science, such as mining engineering, hydrogeology, petroleum
engineering, and environmental sciences, traditional statistical methods fail
to provide unbiased estimates of resources due to the presence of geospatial
correlation. Geostatistics (a.k.a. geospatial statistics) is the branch of
statistics developed to overcome this limitation. Particularly, it is the
branch that takes geospatial coordinates of data into account.

[GeoStats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl) is an attempt to bring
together bleeding-edge research in the geostatistics community into a comprehensive
framework for geospatial modeling, as well as to empower researchers and practioners
with a toolkit for fast assessment of different modeling approaches.

The design of this project is the result of many years developing geostatistical
software. I hope that it can serve to promote more collaboration between
geostatisticians around the globe and to standardize this incredible field of
research. If you would like to help support the project, please star the repository
[![STARS](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl?style=social)]
(https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl) and share it with your colleagues.
If you would like to extend the framework with new geostatistical solvers,
please check the [Developer guide](contributing/solvers.md).

## Quick example

Below is a quick preview of the high-level API:

```@example overview
using GeoStats
using Plots
gr(size=(900,400)) # hide

# attribute table
table = (Z=[1.,0.,1.],)

# coordinates for each row
coord = [(25.,25.), (50.,75.), (75.,50.)]

# georeference data
ùíü = georef(table, coord)

# estimation domain
ùí¢ = CartesianGrid(100, 100)

# estimation problem
problem = EstimationProblem(ùíü, ùí¢, :Z)

# choose a solver from the list of solvers
solver = Kriging(
  :Z => (variogram=GaussianVariogram(range=35.),)
)

# solve the problem
solution = solve(problem, solver)

# plot the solution
contourf(solution, clabels=true)
```

[Basic workflow](workflow.md) section of the
documentation.

## Project organization

The project is split into various packages:

| Package | Description |
|:-------:|:------------|
| [GeoStats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl) | Main package reexporting full stack of packages for geostatistics. |
| [Variography.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/Variography.jl) | Variogram estimation and modeling, and related tools. |
| [KrigingEstimators.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/KrigingEstimators.jl) | High-performance implementations of Kriging estimators. |
| [PointPatterns.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/PointPatterns.jl) | Geospatial point pattern analysis and synthesis. |
| [GeoClustering.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoClustering.jl) | Geostatistical clustering (a.k.a. domaining). |
| [GeoEstimation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoEstimation.jl) | Built-in solvers for geostatistical estimation. |
| [GeoSimulation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoSimulation.jl) | Built-in solvers for geostatistical simulation. |
| [GeoLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoLearning.jl) | Built-in solvers for geostatistical learning. |
| [GeoStatsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStatsBase.jl) | Base package containing core definitions. |

The main [GeoStats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStats.jl) package
reexports the full stack of packages for high-performance geostatistics
in Julia. Other packages can be installed separately for additional
functionality:

| Package | Description |
|:-------:|:------------|
| [GeoStatsImages.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoStatsImages.jl) | Training images for multiple-point simulation. |
| [GeoTables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoTables.jl) | (Down)load geospatial tables in various formats. |
| [DrillHoles.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/DrillHoles.jl) | Desurvey/composite drillhole data. |
| [GslibIO.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GslibIO.jl) | Load/save (extended) GSLIB files. |

Besides the packages above, the project is extended via
[solver packages](solvers/summary.md). These solvers are implemented
independently of the main package for different geostatistical problems.
