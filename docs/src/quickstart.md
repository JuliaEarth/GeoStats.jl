# Quickstart

```@example quickstart
using JSServe: Page # hide
Page(exportable=true, offline=true) # hide
```

A geostatistical workflow often consists of four steps:

1. Creation of geospatial data
2. Manipulation of geospatial data
3. Definition of geostatistical problem
4. Visualization of problem solution

In this section, we walk through these steps to illustrate some of the
features of the project. If you prefer learning from video, check the

## Loading/creating data

### Loading data

The Julia ecosystem for loading geospatial data is comprised of several
low-level packages such as [Shapefile.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/Shapefile.jl)
and [GeoJSON.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoJSON.jl), which define
their own very basic geometry types. Instead of requesting users to learn
the so called [GeoInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterface.jl)
to handle these types, we provide the high-level
[GeoTables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEarth/GeoTables.jl) package to
load any file with geospatial data into well-tested geometries from the
[Meshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl) submodule:

```@example quickstart
using GeoTables

zone = GeoTables.load("data/zone.shp")
path = GeoTables.load("data/path.shp")

viz(zone.geometry)
viz!(path.geometry, color = :gray90)
Mke.current_figure()
```

Various functions are defined over these geometries, for instance:

```@example quickstart
sum(area, zone.geometry)
```

```@example quickstart
sum(perimeter, zone.geometry)
```

Please check the [Meshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl)
documentation for more details.

!!! note

    We **highly recommend** using Meshes.jl geometries in geospatial workflows as
    they were carefully designed to accomodate advanced features of the GeoStats.jl
    framework. Any other geometry type will likely fail with our geostatistical
    algorithms and pipelines.

### Creating data

Geospatial data can also be derived from other Julia variables. For example,
given a Julia array (or image), which is not attached to any particular
coordinate system, we can georeference the array using the [`georef`](@ref)
function:

```@example quickstart
Z = [10sin(i/10) + 2j + k for i in 1:100, j in 1:100, k in 1:100]

Œ© = georef((Z=Z,))
```

The origin and spacing of samples can be specified with:

```@example quickstart
georef((Z=Z,), origin = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), spacing = (10.0, 10.0, 10.0))
```

and different geospatial configurations can be obtained with different
methods (see [Data](data.md)).

Geospatial data can be visualized with a simple call to `viz`:

```@example quickstart
viz(Œ©.geometry, color = Œ©.Z)
```

## Manipulating data

### Table interface

Our geospatial data implements the
[Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface, which
means that they can be accessed as if they were tables with samples
in the rows and variables in the columns. In this case, a special
column named `geometry` is created on the fly, row by row, containing
[Meshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl) geometries.

For those familiar with the productive
[DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) interface,
there is nothing new:

```@example quickstart
Œ©[1,:]
```

```@example quickstart
Œ©[1,:geometry]
```

```@example quickstart
Œ©.Z
```

However, notice that our implementation performs some clever
optimizations behind the scenes to avoid expensive creation
of geometries:

```@example quickstart
Œ©.geometry
```

We can always retrieve the table of attributes (or features)
with the function [`values`](@ref) and the underlying geospatial
domain with the function [`domain`](@ref). This can be useful for
writing algorithms that are *type-stable* and depend purely on the
geometry or on the feature values:

```@example quickstart
values(Œ©)
```

```@example quickstart
domain(Œ©)
```

### Table transforms

It is easy to design advanced geospatial pipelines that operate on
both the table of attributes and the underlying geospatial domain:

```@example quickstart
# pipeline with table transforms
pipe = Quantile() ‚Üí StdCoords()

# feed geospatial data to pipeline
Œ©ÃÑ = pipe(Œ©)

# plot distribution before and after pipeline
fig = Mke.Figure(resolution = (800, 400))
Mke.hist(fig[1,1], Œ©.Z)
Mke.hist(fig[2,1], Œ©ÃÑ.Z)
fig
```

```@example quickstart
# coordinates before and after pipeline
boundingbox(Œ©.geometry), boundingbox(Œ©ÃÑ.geometry)
```

These pipelines are revertible meaning that one can transform the data,
perform geostatistical modeling, and revert the pipelines to obtain
estimates in the original sample space (see [Transforms](transforms.md)).

### Split-apply-combine

We provide three macros [`@groupby`](@ref), [`@transform`](@ref) and
[`@combine`](@ref) for powerful geospatial split-apply-combine patterns:

```@example quickstart
@transform(Œ©, :W = 2 * :Z * volume(:geometry))
```

These macros are very useful for geodata science as they hide the
complexity of the `geometry` column. For more information, check
the [Split-apply-combine](splitapplycombine.md) section of the
documentation.

### Geospatial views

Geospatial data can be viewed at a subset of locations without
unnecessary memory allocations:

```@example quickstart
Œ©·µ• = view(Œ©, 1:100*100*10)

viz(Œ©·µ•.geometry, color = Œ©·µ•.Z)
```

We plot a random view of the grid to emphasize that views do not
preserve geospatial regularity:

```@example quickstart
Œ©·µ£ = view(Œ©, rand(1:100*100*100, 1000))

viz(Œ©·µ£.geometry, color = Œ©·µ£.Z)
```

### Geospatial partitions

Geospatial data can be partitioned with various efficient methods.
To demonstrate the operation, we partition our geospatial data view
into balls of given radius:

```@example quickstart
Œ† = partition(Œ©.geometry, BallPartition(5.))

viz(Œ†)
```

or, alternatively, into two halfspaces:

```@example quickstart
Œ† = partition(Œ©.geometry, BisectFractionPartition((1.0, 1.0, 1.0), 0.5))

viz(Œ†)
```

Geospatial partitions are (lazy) iterators of geospatial views, which
are useful in many contexts as it will be shown in the next section.
To access a subset of a partition, we use index notation:

```@example quickstart
viz(Œ†[1])
```

```@example quickstart
viz(Œ†[2])
```

Various other geospatial operations are defined in the framework besides
partitioning. For a complete list, please check the reference guide and
the [Meshes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl) documentation.

## Defining problems

Having defined the geospatial data objects, we proceed and define the
geostatistical problem to be solved. In this guide, we illustrate
*geostatistical learning*. For other types of geostatistical problems,
please check the [Problems](problems.md) section of the documentation.

Let's assume that we have geopatial data with some variable that we want
to predict in a supervised learning setting. We load the data from a CSV
file, and inspect the available columns:

```@example quickstart
using CSV

csv = CSV.File("data/agriculture.csv")
```

Columns `band1`, `band2`, ..., `band4` represent four satellite bands
for different locations `(x,y)` in this region. The column `crop` has
the crop type for each location that was labeled manually with the
purpose of training a learning model. Because the labels are categorical
variables, we need to inform the framework the correct scientific type from
[ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/ScientificTypes.jl):

```@example quickstart
table = csv |> Coerce(:crop => Multiclass)

first(table.crop, 5)
```

We can now georeference the table and plot some of the variables:

```@example quickstart
Œ© = georef(table, (:x, :y))

fig = Mke.Figure(resolution = (800, 400))
viz(fig[1,1], Œ©.geometry, color = Œ©.band4, pointsize = 2)
viz(fig[1,2], Œ©.geometry, color = Œ©.crop, pointsize = 2)
fig
```

Similar to a generic statistical learning workflow, we split the data
into "train" and "test" sets. The main difference here is that our
geospatial `split` function accepts a separating plane specified by
its normal direction `(1,-1)`:

```@example quickstart
Œ©s, Œ©t = split(Œ©, 0.2, (1.0, -1.0))

viz(Œ©s.geometry, pointsize = 2)
viz!(Œ©t.geometry, color = :gray90, pointsize = 2)
Mke.current_figure()
```

We can visualize the domain of the "train" (or source) set Œ©s in blue,
and the domain of the "test" (or target) set Œ©t in gray. We reserved
20% of the samples to Œ©s and 80% to Œ©t. Internally, this geospatial
`split` function is implemented in terms of efficient geospatial
partitions, which were illustrated in the previous section.

Let's define the learning task and the geostatistical learning problem.
We want to predict the crop type based on the four satellite bands.
We will train the model in Œ©s where labels are available, and apply it
to Œ©t, which is our target:

```@example quickstart
feats = [:band1,:band2,:band3,:band4]
label = :crop

ùíØ = ClassificationTask(feats, label)

ùí´ = LearningProblem(Œ©s, Œ©t, ùíØ)
```

GeoStats.jl is integrated with the
[MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl)
project, which means that we can solve geostatistical learning problems
with more than 150 classical learning models:

```@example quickstart
using MLJ

‚Ñ≥ = MLJ.@load DecisionTreeClassifier pkg=DecisionTree

‚Ñí = PointwiseLearn(‚Ñ≥())
```

In this example, we selected a `PointwiseLearn` strategy to solve the
geostatistical learning problem. This strategy consists of applying the
learning model pointwise for every location in the geospatial data:

```@example quickstart
Œ©ÃÇt = solve(ùí´, ‚Ñí)
```

## Plotting solutions

We note that the solution to a geostatistical learning problem is a
geospatial data object, and we can inspect it with the same methods
already described above. This also means that we can plot the solution
directly, side by side with the true label in this synthetic example:

```@example quickstart
fig = Mke.Figure(resolution = (800, 400))
viz(fig[1,1], Œ©ÃÇt.geometry, color = Œ©ÃÇt.crop, pointsize = 2)
viz(fig[1,2], Œ©t.geometry, color = Œ©t.crop, pointsize = 2)
fig
```

Visually, it seems that the learning model is predicting the crop type.
We can also estimate the generalization error of the geostatistical solver
with [geostatistical validation methods](validation.md) such as block
cross-validation and leave-ball-out, but these methods deserve
a separate tutorial.

With this example we conclude the basic workflow. To get familiar with
other features of the project, please check the tutorials and the
reference guide.
